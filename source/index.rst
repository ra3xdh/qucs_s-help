QUCS-S Documentation
==================================

Add your content using ``reStructuredText`` syntax. See the
`reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_
documentation for details.

This is a test to be sure ReadTheDocs is automatically building on commit, and automatically building PRs...

And this text is another test to see if adjusting webhooks fixed PR builds with ReadTheDocs.

Real content coming soon!
